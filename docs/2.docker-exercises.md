# Docker - Exercises
These are steps to complete the two exercises in Docker
that I demonstrated yesterday, a recording of which is available
[here on YouTube](https://youtu.be/gT9VahFQw-M).

## Exercise 1
### Running a simple C programme in Docker
Steps:
1. Navigate to the [Docker Playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).
2. Add a new instance of Docker in the playground.
3. Analyze the C programme code given in [this repository](https://github.com/paramsiddharth/docker-calcsum-example).
4. Clone the repository inside Docker Playground and open the folder.
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/paramsiddharth/docker-calcsum-example.git

   cd docker-calcsum-example
   ```
5. Build the image using Docker.
   ``` bash
   docker build -t c_code .
   ```
6. Check the newly-created image using
   ``` bash
   docker images
   ```
7. Execute the image in a temporary interactive container.
   ``` bash
   docker run --rm -it c_code
   ```
8. Delete the image.
   ``` bash
   docker rmi c_code
   ```
9. Exit Docker Playground.

## Exercise 2
### Running a simple web server in Docker
Steps:
1. Navigate to the [Docker Playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).
2. Add a new instance of Docker in the playground.
3. Have an overview of [this repository](https://github.com/paramsiddharth/docker-static-website-lighttpd).
4. Clone the repository inside Docker Playground and open the folder.
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/paramsiddharth/docker-static-website-lighttpd.git

   cd docker-static-website-lighttpd
   ```
5. Build the image using Docker.
   ``` bash
   docker build -t static_website .
   ```
6. Check the newly-created image using
   ``` bash
   docker images
   ```
7. Execute the image in a temporary container, mapping local port 3000 to port 80 of the container.
   ``` bash
   docker run --rm -p 3000:80 static_website
   ```
8. Open port 3000 in the playground to visit the website launched.
9. Press `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C` while in the playgroud terminal to stop the container.
10. Delete the image.
   ``` bash
   docker rmi static_website
   ```
11. Exit Docker Playground.
