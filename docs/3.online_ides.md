# Online IDEs
A summary of yesterday's session and a list of the online IDEs I talked about. A recordiing of the workshop is available [here on YouTube](https://youtu.be/VbLxMJoDP_U).

## IDEs

### [CS50 Sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/)
A temporary environment for some simple coding.

### [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/)
An advanced environment for development and learning.

### [REPL.it](https://repl.it/)
An online environment for developing applications.

### [IDEOne](https://ideone.com/)
An online IDE to test competitive programming code.

## Coding Exercise
Follow the below steps to compile and run a simple C programme in any of the above IDEs:

1. Follow the link and copy the source code of [this C programme](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/paramsiddharth/a71abbbdd9247206038f121793ea43ee/raw/4406bd8158720ae4242d9e307b2aa89bf669f7fa/hello.c).
   ``` c
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   int main() {
   	printf("Hello, World!\n");
   	return 0;
   }
   ```
2. Create a new file named `hello.c` in your online IDE and paste the code.
3. Use any of the below-mentioned commands to compile and run your programme using GCC:
    1.  Default compilation to `a.out`.
        - Compile: 
          ``` bash
          gcc hello.c
   	      ```
        - Run: 
          ``` bash
          ./a.out
   	      ```
    2.  Customizing the name of the compiled executable.
        - Compile: 
          ``` bash
          gcc -o hello hello.c
   	      ```
        - Run: 
          ``` bash
          ./hello
   	      ```
    3.  Using GNU Make to compile.
        - Compile: 
          ``` bash
          make hello
   	      ```
        - Run: 
          ``` bash
          ./hello
   	      ```

Now, try the same programme, but instead of `Hello, World!`, enter your name in the code. Happy learning!
