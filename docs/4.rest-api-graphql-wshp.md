# REST API and GraphQL - An Overview
We discussed the REST API, GraphQL, and their usage. A recording of the session demonstrations is available [here](https://youtu.be/MO4LqXv9pDk).

## REST API
_Representational State Transfer is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services._ 

It is abundantly used in web applications for data retrieval, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Below are the 4 request-types we discussed:
1. `GET`
   - Used to retrieve data.  
   - The request body doesn't have significance, but the endpoint does.
2. `POST`
   - Used to insert data.
   - Both request body and the endpoint are significant.
3. `PUT`
   - Used to update data.
   - Both request body and the endpoint are significant.
4. `DELETE`
   - Used to delete data.
   - The request body doesn't have significance, but the endpoint does.

## GraphQL
The limitations of the REST API are:
- We are victim to overfetching. We can't selectively choose which properties to retrieve, unless we are using extensive non-standard techniques.
- `GET` and `DELETE` requests don't use any data provided in the request body.

To overcome these, and possibly several other limitations, GraphQL was born.
