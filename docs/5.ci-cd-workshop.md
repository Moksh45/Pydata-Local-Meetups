# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
The above terms are associated with popular modern development practices.
- Continuous Integration: The process of continuously merging and testing changes to the main codebase.
- Continuous Deployment: Deliver changes in the codebase to the main application.

A recording of the session demonstrations is available [here](https://youtu.be/SJYAJhwb6c4).

## Continuous Integration: Exercise
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/paramsiddharth/congenial-funicular) and clone it locally.
2. Create a new file named `<yourname>.yml` inside `.github/workflows`.
3. Copy the code [given here](https://gist.github.com/paramsiddharth/7faf33f0ffb65230b6132710cee6e1b0) and paste it inside the file.
4. Create a new file named `<yourname>.c` inside the repository and write an application that displays your name.
5. Commit the changes and push it to your remote repository.
6. Verify the workflow.
7. Once done, create a pull request and wait for magic. :)

## Continuous Deployment: Exercise
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/paramsiddharth/ci-cd-example2).
2. Go to the settings.
3. Under GitHub Pages source, choose your main branch (usually `main`).
