# Git Commands - An Overview
I have tried to summarize some of the basic Git commands I demonstrated recently. Before starting that, let me make a few points:
- The standard name for the default branch is `main`. It used to be `master` until we realized it had roots from racist terminology and decided to change it.
- The standard names for the default remote are `origin` and `upstream`. For forked repositories, `origin` is commonly used for the fork and `upstream` for the parent.
- Not all the Git commands are listed below. You shall continue to explore and discover how to utilize Git on your own as you use it.

The exercise is available in [this repository](https://github.com/paramsiddharth/learning-git-juet-2020), and a recording of the repeated session is available [here on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ViNsy6VuDWQ).

## `git config`
To manage i. e. view and update Git variables. I am including this at the top 
because I missed it during yesterday's session.

Every commit carries a signature of the person who made it. It is a bad practice not to
include information regarding the commit's author. Ensuring that, we need to configure Git
to identify us. This configuration is one-time and will be saved on the device. I urge you to 
do this right now.

My name is `Param Siddharth` and my e-mail address is [`contact@paramsid.com`](mailto:contact@paramsid.com). In this example, 
I will do the one-time global configuration by executing the following commands:
``` bash
git config --global user.name 'Param Siddharth'
git config --global user.email 'contact@paramsid.com'
```

Replace the name and e-mail address with your own. This will save your details for all future
commits, and is essential for using Git. Make sure you use your public e-mail address and not a
private one.

To see the current configuration, execute:
``` bash
git config --list
```

## `git init`
Initializes a repository in the current directory.

## `git status`
Displays the current status of the repository.

## `git add`
Used to add files to the staging area for the next commit.
E. g. To add `yay.txt`, execute
``` bash
git add yay.txt
```

We usually need to add everything in the current directory to the staging area. For that, we execute:
``` bash
git add .
```

## `git commit`
Saves the current staged changes as a new commit.

Remember to always add a short comprehensible commit message. Don't forget to add the changes to the staging area with `git add .` before committing.
``` bash
git commit -m 'Your message here'
```

## `git branch`
Retrieve the current/all branch[es] or make a new one.

The following will tell you the name of the current branch.
``` bash
git branch
```

To create a new branch named `prasad`, use the following:
``` bash
git branch -M prasad
```

## `git log`
Retrieve a list of all commits in the currently active branch.

Press `q` to exit and arrow keys to navigate.
``` bash
git log
```

For a simpler representation of the list, use the `--oneline` switch.
``` bash
git log --oneline

```

## `git remote`
Retrieve, add, or update remote addresses.

Use the following to retrieve a list of remote repositories with their respective URLs:
``` bash
git remote -v
```

Let's say you want to add a new remote with address `https://www.kya.bat/hai.git` and name it `iamahero`. To do that, execute:
``` bash
git remote add iamahero https://www.kya.bat/hai.git
```

## `git push`
Push changes to a remote repository.

Let's say you want to push the updates from branch `prasad` to remote `iamahero`. For that, execute:
``` bash
git push -u iamahero prasad
```

## `git pull`
Pull changes from a remote repository, id est antonymous to `git push`.

Let's say you want to pull the updates from branch `prasad` of remote `iamahero`. For that, execute:
``` bash
git pull iamahero prasad
```

## `git clone`
Clone an online repository locally.

To clone a remote repository identified by `https://www.kya.bat/hai.git`, execute:
``` bash
git clone https://www.kya.bat/hai.git
```

This will do the following:
- Create a local directory with the same name as the repository (here, `hai`).
- Clone the remote repository into the folder.
- Add a remote named `origin` (semantically so) with address `https://www.kya.bat/hai.git` to the clone.

Note that the clone will include the entire commit history of the remote repository. If you don't need old commits and want to save space, use the following instead:
``` bash
git clone --depth 1 https://www.kya.bat/hai.git
```

## `git reset`
Resets to an older commit.

Let's say you want to revert to previous commit identified as `07e239f`. For that, use:
``` bash
git reset 07e239f
```

Doing a hard reset means get rid of the current staging area and uncommitted changes as well as revert to the desired commit. To do a hard reset, use:
``` bash
git reset --hard 07e239f
```

The last commit is always identified as `HEAD`. Hence, commonly, to reset the workspace to the last commit, we execute the following:
``` bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```
